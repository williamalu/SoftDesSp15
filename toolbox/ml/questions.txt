1. What is the general trend in the curve?

The general trend in the curve is upward, as expected - the more data is used for training, the more accurate the model is.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?

Some areas of the curve are noisier than the others because the test does not return the same result every single time. In the noisy areas of the curve,
there are usually a couple of test scores that are outliers - either significantly more or less accurate than average. The documentation on LogisticRegression in
scikit-learn also notes that it "uses a random number generator to select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon, to have slightly different 
results for the same input data."

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

50 trials usually returns a smooth curve.

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.

At C values of 10**-1, the curve rises extremely quickly but plateaus.  At C values of 10**-100, the curve is noisy and accuracy on the test set is extremely low.
